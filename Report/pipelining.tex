In this section, we will be looking at pipelining our single cycle MIPS
processor, and handle the problems, which are introduced by pipelining.

We start by going through the background and motivation for pipelining, and
then proceed on how to extend our single cycle MIPS processor to have pipes.

As mentioned, pipelining introduces new problems to handle in the processor,
and we will solve it by adding two new components: the forwarding unit, which
forwards results from previous instructions to later instructions, and the
hazard detection unit, which controls when to stall the pipeline, and when the
instruction should read the forwarded value, or the value stored in the
Register File.

Throughout each step, we will also be writing programs, in order to verify that
our processor behaves as specified.
