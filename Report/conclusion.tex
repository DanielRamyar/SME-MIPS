I have succesfully implemented a MIPS processor in the SME programming model,
in the timeframe of $\sim$2 months. This shows that the SME model is
suitable for designing hardware, with the prior knowledge of the CSP model,
hardware organization and software development.

Furthermore, by extending the accepted instruction set, and by pipelining the
processor, I have shown that extending the initial design in order to gain
increased performance or additional functionality, is possible.

I have also shown that SME indeed can be transpiled into functioning VHDL, with
a small amount of extra work. The extra actions are however simple enough, such
that they could be implemented in a future version of SME.

As such, with the material in this thesis, a computer science student, such as
myself, should be able to construct specialized hardware by using SME, in the
timeframe of a university course.

%As such, with the material in this paper, everyone with a computer science
%background should be able to construct specialized hardware by using SME.
